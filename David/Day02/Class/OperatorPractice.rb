=begin
	
I created a script where I'm printing a scripts.
First, I can print numbers and arithmetic results using
arithmetic operators

=end
puts "I will now count my fruits: "
puts "Bananas: #{25 + 30 / 6}"
puts "apples: #{100 - 25 % 4}"

puts "Now I will count the potato:"

puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
puts "What is 3 + 2? It is #{3 + 2}"
puts "What is 5 - 7? It is #{5 - 7}"


#Practice 1
#1. Change the calculations for variables
a = 25 + 30 / 6
b = 100 - 25 % 4
c = 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
d = 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
e = 3 + 2
f = 5 - 7
#2. Add a variable that doesn't exist
x
puts "Bananas: #{a}"
puts "apples: #{b}"
puts c
puts d
puts "x"
puts "What is 3 + 2? It is #{e}"
puts "What is 5 - 7? It is #{f}"
