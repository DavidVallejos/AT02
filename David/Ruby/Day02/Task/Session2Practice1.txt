a) The way to add comments on ruby (inline – multiline)

	inline comments: #
	Example:
		puts 'First' 
		# puts "Second"
		puts "Third"
	Result:
		First
		Third

b) When you should use each type
	I should use inline comments when I just need to add a comment or reminders, and I should
	use multiline when I need a little description about my script, It is to help to the others
	programmers

c) create and script using inline-multiline comments
=begin
	
I created a script where I'm printing a scripts.
First, I can print numbers and arithmetic results using
arithmetic operators

=end
puts "I will now count my fruits: "
puts "Bananas: #{25 + 30 / 6}"
puts "apples: #{100 - 25 % 4}"

puts "Now I will count the potato:"
#Here are all the arithmetic operators
puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
puts "What is 3 + 2? It is #{3 + 2}"
puts "What is 5 - 7? It is #{5 - 7}"
